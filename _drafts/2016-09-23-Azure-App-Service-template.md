The majority of your win artifacts will be included in this section, including (but not limited to) the following: Source code snippets, pictures, drawings, architectural diagrams, value stream mappings and demo videos.

This section should include the following details:

**Directions for adding images:**

1. Create a folder for your project images in the “images” folder in the GitHub repo files. This is where you will add all of the images associated with your write-up.
 
2. Add links to your images using the following absolute path:

  `![Description of the image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/projectname/myimage.png)`

  Here’s an example: 

  `![Value Stream Mapping]({{site.baseurl}}/images/orckestra/orckestra2.jpg)`

3. Note that capitalization of the file name and the file extension must match exactly for the images to render properly.
