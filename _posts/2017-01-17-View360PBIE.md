## Company Profile ##
###### View360 Technologies | Hyderabad, India ######
View360 Technologies is an innovative IT Outsourcing and Consultancy company with various monitoring solutions: Telecom Tower Monitoring, IT Infrastructure Monitoring, Remote Asset Monitoring, Energy Optimization and Video Surveillance. They also engage in Telecom and Infrastrcuture and Consultancy services.

The Telecom Tower Monitoring solution is meant for monitoring the telecom tower infra operations, telecom switching & transmission nodes event management. It has been acknowledged as a cost-effective solution with an automation approach that factors in the real-world issues like network instability,power instability, human dependencies and operational constraints in the network. It is aimed at maximizing the operational efficiency under severe power shortage and unstable power conditions in the field.

The Telecom Tower Monitoring Solution (telView360) is an integrated solution that alleviates maintenance issues associated with BTS sites due to geographical spread and infrastructure challenges. telView360 consists of 3 levels of intelligence – continuous event monitoring, processing and controlling of event generated data and communicating with a remote server. These 3 levels of intelligence are used to enable the Telecom Service Provider to automate the controlling functions which ensure smooth running of BTS infrastructure and to optimize the electric power utilization to lower the operating costs of a BTS site.

## Problem Statement ##
At present, View360 is using a web solution to share reports with telecom operators. A scheduled job runs at 2:00 AM every day and performs the following actions:

- Data extraction from main table
- Calculation of monitored values for defined periods (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) 
- Storage in the reporting table

The users can view the reported data through an ASP.NET application for defined periods. However, if the user selects any period for which data is not present in the reporting table then processing will happen at the client side. The solution consists of a .NET application and SQL running on AWS VMs. The web application is designed using ASP.NET to show reports over web.

For live event reporting, View360 stores latest events in another table and shows a separate report which displays the following values:
- Current temperature
- Battery voltage
- Battery status
- DG status
- Current fuel value

Below are the pain points with existing solution:
- **Visualization**: Current reports are developed in ASP.NET and hence have limited options for visualization.
- **Longer Development Time**: It take more time for developers to design new reports. 
- **Report Rendering**: Data processing happens at client side if the data is not available for the specific period. Hence it takes more time to render reports. 
- **Cross Platform Reporting**: In future, View360 is planning to provide reports over other devices (like mobile, tablet etc.) which is a challenge with the current design.

## Solution ##

**Step1: - Building the end-to-end flow**	

We did a Proof of Concept with View360 team during PowerBI Embedded hackathon to design reports using PowerBI Desktop, deploy to PowerBI Embedded service on Azure and access reports from their .NET application. Reporting data is available on Azure SQL Database.

**Step2: Preparing query for reporting**

We developed an understanding of the reporting requirements from the user and .NET code. View360 team had a 300-line .NET code to process the data for reporting. We converted the entire code into a SQL query. 

Here is the query to display the duration for which EB (Energy Meter) is on/off for a given period and asset number.

        Select
        sum(t.TOTALValue) as durationMinutes, t.EBSTATUS 
        from (
                    select  EBSTATUS, LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY 
                    trackdatetime, EBSTATUS ) as prevtime
                    ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, EBSTATUS                           
                    ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
                    from TABLE_NAME
                    where trackdatetime between '2016-11-05 00:00' and '2016-11-05 23:59'
                    and assetno = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
        ) t   
        Group by t.EBSTATUS

Here is the query to display the duration for which DG (Diesel Generator) is on/off for a given period and asset number.

        Select
        sum(t.TOTALValue) as durationMinutes, t.digital2 
        from (
                select  digital2,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER  
                    (ORDER BY trackdatetime, digital2 ) as prevtime
                    ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, digital2           
                    ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
                from TABLE_NAME
                where trackdatetime between '2016-11-05 00:00' and '2016-11-05 23:59'
                and assetno = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
        ) t   
        Group by t.digital2

Here is the query to display the duration for which Battery is on/off for a given period and asset number.

        Select
        sum(t.TOTALValue) as durationMinutes, t.OnbatteryStatus 
        from (
                  select  OnbatteryStatus, LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY      
                  trackdatetime, OnbatteryStatus ) as prevtime
                  ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime,                                              
                  OnbatteryStatus ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
                  from TABLE_NAME
                  where trackdatetime between '2016-11-05 00:00' and '2016-11-05 23:59'
                  and assetno = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
        ) t   
        Group by t.OnbatteryStatus

**Step3: Report Design**

PowerBI desktop is being used for designing the reports. Now the developers can easily design reports using Direct Query. PowerBI Desktop offers a simple way for the developers to connect to the data source and design the reports using existing control or utilize [PowerBI gallery] (https://app.powerbi.com/visuals/) for custom visualization control.

**Step4: Report Deployment**

For report deployment, we used “provision sample” solution provided by Microsoft. The code is available [here] (https://github.com/Azure-Samples/power-bi-embedded-integrate-report-into-web-app)

**Step5: Report Render**

For report rendering, we used “embedded solution” sample provided by Microsoft from Github. The code is available [here] (https://github.com/Azure-Samples/power-bi-embedded-integrate-report-into-web-app)

**Challenge**: The web application customer had been designed using Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and the customer is not willing to change it to MVC as of now. We wrote below code to render PowerBI Embedded report in Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 using Rest API. In the application, it creates and sends the App Tokens that tells PowerBI Embedded service to render the requested report. This design doesn't require the application to use Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.

        Code Snippet 1– Power BI Rest API call.

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string uri = "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/";
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(uri + "collections/" + workspaceCollection + "/workspaces/" + workspaceId + "/reports");
            request.Headers.Add("Authorization", "AppKey " + accessKey);
            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
            Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);
            string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd();
            string[] Data = responseFromServer.Split('"');
            string EmbeddUrl = Data[21];
            int unixTimestamp = (int)(DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(new DateTime(1970, 1, 1))).TotalSeconds + 1 * 60 * 60;
            String pbieKey1 = "{\"typ\":\"JWT\",\"alg\":\"HS256\"}";
            String pbieKey2 = "{\"wid\":\""+workspaceId+"\",\"rid\":\""+ reportId+"\",\"wcn\":\""+ workspaceCollection+"\",\"iss\":\"PowerBISDK\",\"ver\":\"0.2.0\"," +
                    "\"aud\":\""+ resourceid+"\",\"exp\":"+ unixTimestamp+"}";
            String pbieKey1n2ToBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pbieKey1)).TrimEnd(padding).Replace('+', '-').Replace('/', '_') + "." + Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pbieKey2)).TrimEnd(padding).Replace('+', '-').Replace('/', '_');
            String pbieKey3 = HMAC256EncryptBase64UrlEncode(pbieKey1n2ToBase64, accessKey);
            String access_token = pbieKey1n2ToBase64 + "." + pbieKey3;
            accessTokenText.Value = access_token;
            embedUrlText.Value = EmbeddUrl;
            reader.Close();
            response.Close();
        }
        private String HMAC256EncryptBase64UrlEncode(String str, String accessKey)
        {
            byte[]
            key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(accessKey);
            byte[]
            strBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(str);
            HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(key);
            hmac.Initialize();
            byte[] rawHmac = hmac.ComputeHash(strBytes);
            string b64Str = Convert.ToBase64String(rawHmac);
            return b64Str.TrimEnd(padding).Replace('/', '_').Replace('+', '-').Replace("[", "").Replace("=", "").Replace("]", "");
        }

**Challenge**: The customer wants to provide the ability to users to select multiple parameters to analyze data better. We suggested the use of PowerBI Javascript SDK. However, the problem is we cannot set the parameter position like we can do it in Microsoft SQL server reporting services. In this case,the parameter can’t be set in inner query. The filters passed from JavaScript will always add on outer query. The customer wanted an easier way to put the parameters in the report.

**Solution**: First we simplified the query and then used slicer control in PowerBI desktop. Below is the query after change. We simplified other queries as well. Each query in the report will have “trackdatetime” as a common column.

Here is the query to display the duration for which EB (Energy Meter) is on/off.

        Select  EBstatus, trackdatetime,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, EBstatus ) as prevtime
        ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, EBstatus ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
        From TABLE_NAME

Here is the query to display the duration for which DG (Diesel Generator) is on/off

         Select digital2, trackdatetime as trackdatetime2 ,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, digital2 ) as prevtime
        ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, digital2 ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
        From TABLE_NAME

Here is the query to display the duration for which Battery is on/off.

        Select  OnbatteryStatus, trackdatetime as trackdatetime3,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, OnbatteryStatus ) as prevtime
        ,Datediff(minute,LAG(trackdatetime) OVER (ORDER BY trackdatetime, OnbatteryStatus ), trackdatetime) as TOTALValue
        From TABLE_NAME

**Challenge**: When added slicer to the report, it shows each line for every record in Azure SQL DB. It’s not at all a good experience for end user to select multiple rows in slicer to see data for one day. Below is how slicer shows up in report.

**Solution**: After research, we figured out that there were changes done for slicer control in November update of PowerBI desktop. We checked and updated PowerBI Desktop to the latest version (November 2016 as of now). Below is how slicer shows up in report after applying update.

## Opportunities going forward ##

We will continue to engage with View360 to help them in designing and manageability of PBIE reports.   

Once they gather enough data, they will also use Azure machine learning for predictive analytics and show same on PBIE reports.

## Recommendations ##

- Keep PowerBI desktop always updated. This is can be done by automatically if “Display update notifications for Power BI Desktop” is checked under updates in options (File-> options and settings).
- Check for PowerBI visual library for custom visuals.
- Keep Azure SQL and PowerBI embedded in same region. This is to avoid any egress charges. 
- Bring only data which is required for reporting. 
- For report deployment/maintenance use existing sample provided by Microsoft in github or use PowerBI CLI.
- Use App token for embedding reports in application if not using azure active directory. Set an expiration time with every App token.

## Conclusion ##

The Microsoft and View360 teams worked closely to conclude a successful implementation of the PowerBI Embedded solution. The View360 team had their solution running on AWS. We used Azure SQL Database and Power BI embedded, which are platform as a service (PaaS) services. Hence the integration was quick and straightforward.

The PowerBI Embedded solution will benefit various stakeholder and developer as follows:
- Design PowerBI reports with ease and more visualization control.
- Monitoring the health of telecom tower.
- Detailed analysis of various devices.
- Integrate dashboard on cross platform (web, mobile, tablet etc.) in future.
