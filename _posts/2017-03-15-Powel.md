## Meet **Andre** the elecrical Engineer assistant
In this CaaP hackfest, Microsoft teamed up with Powel to hack a brand-new solution **Andre**. We describe the process and results here, including the following 
technologies:

-  [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/)
-  [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services)
    - [Language Understanding Intelligent Services (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai/)
    - [Translation API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/translator-api)
    - [Bing Spell Check API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-spell-check-api)
- [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)
- Text-to-speech
    - [Bing Speech API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api)
- [DocumentDb](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- etc

Additionally, the team expressed a need for getting more hands-on experience with
- Test Automation
- CI/CD scenarios
- etc

The hackfest took place after a couple of initial calls where the problem area was detailed, and 
ambition for  the hackfest scoped. 

## Conversation as a Platform
During the hackfest, we implemented the following:
- Xamarin app 
- Translation
- etc

## Focus of the hackfest


## Problem statement
Powel envisions a future where on-site engineers can use their natural voice as the main driver for computer-assisted support during inspection of power facilities. 
An inspection of an electrical station, or line inspections using **Andre**, will free up the engineers hands, which gives a more fluent process than having to fill out a paper form,
or plot data into a device application.
Utilizing the capabilities of a wearable device, such as a mobile phone, the application will automatically understand which facility is being inspected by 
obtaining the users GPS location, and provide the necessary checkpoint lists and dialogs appropriate to that facility.

The hackfest focused on two distinct inspection targets: 
- Power Station inspection
- Power Line inspection

The goal was to be able to design two distinctly different conversation dialogs with enough functionality to be 
tested out in the field. Based on these dialogs, Powel would then have amassed enough experience with conversation as a Platform 
to enrich **Andre** as well as devise similar conversational applications for use in other areas.
