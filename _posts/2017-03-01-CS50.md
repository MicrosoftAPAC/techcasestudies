A major US research university partnered with Microsoft to learn and deploy Microsoft Azure infrastructure, Web Apps, and DevOps best practices to better address their need to quickly, easily, and consistently onboard classroom infrastructure apps to Azure Cloud Services. This included migrating existing apps running on local hardware to the cloud. 

The class is delivered each term to:
- A few thousand students in the classroom.
- More than 10,000 students online that view and interact real-time with the class.
- Another 90,000 students online that view the class non-interactively.

This means the infrastructure needs to support more than 100,000 students in any term, and as a result, all applications and services must be able to scale on demand, including the following:  

- Azure Linux VMs
- Azure Blob Storage
- Infrastructure as Code
- Docker
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) through Codeship.com 

The project took place over the course of three weeks with the premise of standing up all infrastructure needed in Azure, and completely automating everything so that all applications could simply be plugged into a GitHub repo to deploy. In the professor’s words, "I need you to get GitHub, Codeship, and Azure working together, and wire it all up." The project team was composed of members from both Microsoft and the university and included:

- Professor, major US university – Defined requirements
- Senior TA (no Dev role in project), major US university – Leveraged processes and code for deploying all classroom apps 
- [Rachel White](https://twitter.com/ohhoe) – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft – Project Lead  
- [Jessica Deen](https://twitter.com/jldeen) – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft – Developer
- [Dan Stolts](https://twitter.com/itproguru) – Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft – Dev Lead

All source code can be found on [GitHub](http:/github.com/jldeen/codeship).

This project shows how a large computer science class leveraged Azure and Codeship to streamline their current application pipeline and container environment with little or no work needed to maintain and manage the following:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Docker
- Codeship
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Azure Container Service

## Customer profile

This US university is world-class, well known for its research and its alumni. For now, they would prefer to remain anonymous, so this document will refer to them as "the university."

One of their most attended courses is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages used and taught in this class are just as diverse. For this document, we will refer to this computer science class as simply "the class." Teacher Assistants (TAs) are made up of graduate and doctoral students who are supporting the professor and the class; collectively, the professor and TAs are referred to as "the staff."

The class provides more than 40 different applications and services for their students. Some are hosted on-premises while others are offered on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud platform. A diverse selection of languages is used to deliver applications and services, so the class can use their own apps as real time examples of the principles they teach.


## Problem statement
The staff want the ability to expand the class without expanding IT infrastructure. They want to scale their current container environment to the cloud so they can grow without acquiring and laying down significant additional hardware or upfront capital. They also have applications currently running in AWS but want to reduce lock-in and risk associated with having only one provider.

The project will be documented so additional TAs could be brought in with minimal training required. The university would like us to help them stand up a single simple app that they will then use as a base for porting their other applications. The deployment should be able to be done by deploying to Azure (any language) including CI/CD. The professor prefers Codeship for CI/CD but it was not required. Using GitHub for a code repository was a requirement.

### Creating the value stream map (VSM)
The value stream mapping portion of the project was designed to help the university see the big picture and understand where automation, proper processes, and DevOps practices can improve processes, expand capabilities, decrease setup time, and simplify standing up systems in a cloud environment. 

The professor is already very familiar with DevOps tools and practices and knows how to apply them, which is why he wanted to engage Microsoft in this project (he did not care to share his current processes externally). To walk through the application development pipeline, we simply laid out what a fully optimized environment would look like. This gave the professor a great teaching tool for his TAs to create successful applications with the least amount of waste, lead time, and processing time. In this educational setting where there are no full-time employees working on code, there could be much waste and lead/lag time as TAs work through schedules. In the new, optimized environment, the individual TAs could work anytime they have time, which is often almost daily.

As we walked through the VSM, it was clear we would need to fully understand Codeship CI/CD so that we could decide whether to use Codeship as a final solution. We studied the existing documentation for AWS deployment through Codeship and could easily create a process to do the same on Azure. We also found the Codeship CI/CD platform to be a great platform for CI/CD and DevOps. We reached out to Codeship directly to let them know we were undertaking this project to see if they had any additional features or capabilities we might be able to leverage. This was a great discussion. Codeship offered to run a few online training classes to get our engineers up to speed, and offered to assist us in expanding the capabilities of our solution. Codeship wanted to make this a generally available part of their platform and document repository. We spun this off into a different project with Codeship directly. This class project and the Codeship project worked together so we were all helping each other. In fact, the output of this project was used directly as input for the Codeship project. As the Codeship project added capabilities, they could easily be rolled back into this one. It was an incredible opportunity for two different teams to work together and leverage each other's work!

Value stream maps are a great vehicle to understand an existing workflow and to decide which areas to focus on for improvement. Because we did not have access to data of how things work now, we focused on a green field process. The following diagram is where we landed.

The project we defined and delivered was exactly what they were looking for. 

It would be several months before the staff could put the new process in production. It is unfeasible to make major changes in the middle of a class this size, so full deployment and migration will wait until summer. After the solution is fully deployed, limitations on deploying apps and services in the middle of a class term will be minimized and in most cases even eliminated. This will offer tremendous value to the staff and the university. The professor was pleased with the process and practices we put together and delivered. They were also happy to have an easy migration path to Azure from AWS. They cannot start these moves right now because class is in session, but they will be using it extensively in the summer.

Following are a few of the major issues or time challenges we uncovered and fixed:
- The time it takes new TAs to get up to speed on managing and maintaining applications was significant (many months).
- Running a single VM for each container is wasteful, significantly increases cost, and hampers time to scale. 
- Managing the infrastructure (VM) is overkill for some of the applications; these should be able to be run as a cloud service. 

You can see from the VSM that there is little lag or wasted time in the new process. Though we were unable to identify any waste, there may be lag associated with the project because the TAs are the only workers, and they are not available to work on the application full-time. 

The automation, where CI played an important role, was tackled by the Codeship.com Cloud Service. Staff expectation is that they will continue to grow and add additional capabilities in future classroom application deployments. This new process will be used for new applications; existing applications will also be ported starting with on-premises apps.

We incorporated Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, Linux VMs, and Docker into this solution. We also inherited monitoring from both Codeship and Azure built-in capabilities.


### Project objectives
After completing the value stream mapping, the goal of the project was to create a GitHub repository that would contain all the code and instructions needed to easily drop it into the class repository. The university wanted to fork the solution, deploy it in their own GitHub account, and drop in their own application. They would then need to set up the basics such as updating config files for their Azure subscription, Codeship account, GitHub account, and Service Principle credentials. Instructions on how to make these changes would also be required.  

The various scripts included: 

- Docker Compose file
- Codeship Steps file
- Codeship Service config file
- Bash scripts 
- ARM templates to deploy VMs to Azure

## Solution, steps, and delivery
The professor opted to have Microsoft do all the work instead of having his TAs directly involved. He wanted us to teach him and his team how it all works through documentation. With this approach, the staff could vet out the documentation as they went through the first deployment. It was a perfect solution for an environment where your development staff turns over regularly as TAs advance and move on. This was also a great opportunity for Microsoft engineers working on this project to test their coding skills and their documentation skills in a single project. We found more great value by sharing documentation to the masses through open source and through a direct collaboration with Codeship. 

The class had already converted some of their apps from on-premises to AWS and found some challenges and limitations in that solution. One such example was when using GitHub, Codeship, and AWS they got apps working but they observed quirks (such as “One container per VM”). Our mission was to do it right, without any of the "quirks" or limitations. This would allow the class to spend less money for their applications and provide a simple way to migrate between Azure and AWS. 

### Infrastructure as Code

Jessica Deen first worked on implementing Azure support within Codeship by creating an SPN creation script. Using the SPN and Azure CLI, Jessica could add support for Azure through Codeship where it previously did not exist. Following is an example of this script.

Jessica then created a deployment shell script utilizing the GitHub quickstart templates to stand up a simple Docker VM with all necessary resources through Codeship's CD tool. Following is an example of this script.

![Using SPN Creation Script]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-03-01-CS50/deploy_example.png)

With a Docker VM running in Azure, we then continued to use Codeship to pass commands through SSH to the Docker engine. In doing so, Jessica created a new method allowing users to deploy apps to new containers on the Docker VM in Azure. Following is an example of the app deployment script.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

We are able to use these infrastructure deployment and application deployment scripts by tying them into what Codeship refers to as steps in their configuration.yaml files. Following are examples of both the codeship-services.yaml and codeship-steps.yaml files.

![Codeship-Services]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-03-01-CS50/codeshipservices_example.png)

![Codeship-Steps]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-03-01-CS50/codeshipsteps_example.png)

By design, Codeship's steps reference "services" created. Those services will fire off the commands defined in the codeship-steps.yaml file. An example of those commands in action deploying the Docker infrastructure through Codeship can be seen from Codeship's monitoring tool.

![Codeship-IAC]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-03-01-CS50/csiac_example.png)

An example of those commands in action copying the test app from host to VM, creating a Docker image, and running the image in a new container through Codeship can be seen in the following screenshot from Codeship's monitoring tool.

![Codeship-App]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-03-01-CS50/csapp_example.png)

All of these scripts can be used for each stage of the process including Dev, QA, Test, and Prod. The solution developed through this process can be used by any person who needs to spin up a new container in an existing Docker VM on Azure, or any person who needs to stand up new Docker infrastructure in Azure from scratch. This new method solved one the largest issues the university faced when they had several TAs create the environment manually through heroic efforts. This new method now automates the creation of both infrastructure and containers through Infrastructure as Code and Continuous Deployment, thereby minimizing the training required and reducing the chance for error.

To help Codeship with their Azure integration, Jessica also wrote the following extensive documentation for how to use the created scripts in conjunction with Codeship's existing tools. 

[Codeship Documentation](https://github.com/jldeen/codeship/blob/master/README.md)

Jessica documented each step of the process as she wrote this solution to get a complete and thorough write-up for those who wish to use this code. This documentation will help the university train their TAs, as well as help Codeship. Aside from the general readme referenced earlier, there is also an individual markdown file for the following scripts:

- create_serviceprincipal.sh
- create_vm_creds.sh

The markdown files describe how to use each script and explain to the end-user what each command in each script does.

## Conclusion
This project is a success. It streamlined the university’s deployment process and provided Codeship users with a well-documented solution to integrate Azure into their pipeline. By keeping detailed records of the steps taken to achieve our goals, Codeship was easily able to create new documentation on their site so that less work will need to be done in the future for any users wanting to use the same DevOps toolchain to automate their processes.

This project provided the university the ability to "move forward" in their DevOps journey by showing them that even though they were already applying DevOps practices (using containers), there was much value in drilling into those practices, looking for waste, and filling the holes that contributed to delays and waste. They now know that taking a quick look at what they are doing is not enough. It is much more important to look at what is possible by evaluating where waste exists and looking for ways to eliminate it. Simply "applying DevOps practices" is not enough. We showed how waste comes in many forms. We found and solved problems for waste in terms of time for new TAs to ramp up, applying consistency to current practices, and saving real money by optimizing deployment methods and tools. 

A solution was delivered leveraging CI/CD through Codeship, Docker, Azure Container Service, and Linux VMs. These technologies and processes will save time and money. 

### Challenges and solutions
The following are the challenges we faced and how we solved them:
- TAs time to ramp up was weeks or months; now it's a few hours.
- Running a single VM for each container was wasteful; now many containers can be run on a single VM.
- Managing the infrastructure (VM) was challenging; running Azure Container Service completely eliminated this challenge. 

Future enhancements to this project can be achieved by opening up the entire development pipeline to scrutiny. The university now knows how to look deeper into current processes to achieve better results. Next they will dive deeper into expanding the monitoring and alerting capabilities of the system running on Azure.
